Code Book

This code book summarizes the results from the data science getting and cleaning data course.

Data Files

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name (see ActivityID below).

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  See SubjectID below.

Identifiers

SubjectID – identifies the individual for whom data was collected.  Individuals were coded 1-30 and were either in the train or test group.

ActivityID – identifies the activity that the particular data was collected for.  The ActivityID was coded 1-6 with the following definitions:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

Measurements – the following measurements were extracted from the data files:
